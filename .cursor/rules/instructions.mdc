- ALWAYS commit changes after each change.
- The apps directory is in ExampleApps
- DO NOT RUN THE APP YOURSELF. I WILL DO THIS SEPARATELY.
- Whenever you make a change to an app in ExampleApps, build the app with npm run build.
- Whenever you are working with an app in ExampleApps, ALWAYS BE SURE YOU ARE IN THE RIGHT DIRECTORY (ExampleApps). You've made a lot of mistakes where you recreated an app in the root project directory which is a serious mistake.
