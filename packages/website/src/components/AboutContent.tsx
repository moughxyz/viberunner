          <h2>Our Vision</h2>
          <p>
            We believe everyone should have the power to create their own desktop tools. Instead of searching through app stores, buying expensive software, or settling for generic solutions, you should be able to dream up exactly what you need and make it real in seconds.
          </p>
          <p>
            {product.productName} is a new paradigm - a powerful runtime that lets you build and run personal desktop applications with nothing more than a simple description of what you want.

          <h2>Philosophy</h2>
          <p>
            {product.productName} is designed as a single-player playground - a personal computing environment where you have complete control. We're not trying to build another app marketplace or social platform. Instead, we're giving you the tools to become your own software developer.
          </p>
          <p>
            Every computer user has unique needs and workflows. Traditional software tries to be everything to everyone, but often ends up being perfect for no one. With {product.productName}, you can build tools that fit your exact requirements, no compromises needed.
